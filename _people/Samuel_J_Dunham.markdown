##### Research Projects

I am working on developing theoretical models for dissipative and resistive
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) inspired by 14-moment methods
for application to, among other things,
pulsar magnetospheres and low-luminosity black hole accretion disks.

For my PhD work at Vanderbilt University/Oak Ridge National Laboratory/University
of Tennessee, Knoxville under the guidance of Kelly Holley--Bockelmann,
Eirik Endeve, and Anthony Mezzacappa,
I helped to develop a module for the
[thornado](https://endeve.github.io/thornado) codebase that solves the GRHD
equations using Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods,
primarily for application to core-collapse supernova simulations.
I also was the primary driver behind coupling thornado to
[amrex](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex), which is a software framework
that allows application codes to make use of MPI parallelism and block-structured
adaptive mesh refinement.

##### Biography

My name is Samuel Dunham (Sam) and I am a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech,
working under the guidance of Elias Most to incorporate dissipative effects
into computer simulations of pulsar magnetospheres and low-luminosity black hole
accretion disks to properly capture non-ideal MHD effects such as
magnetic reconnection.
