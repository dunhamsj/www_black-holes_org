##### Research Projects

I am working on developing theoretical models for dissipative and resistive
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics inspired by 14-moment methods
for application to, among other things,
pulsar magnteospheres and low-luminosity black hole accretion disks.

##### Biography

My name is Samuel Dunham (Sam) and I am a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech,
working under the guidance of Elias Most to incorporate dissipative effects
into computer simulations of pulsar magnetospheres and low-luminosity black hole
accretion disks to properly capture non-ideal MHD effects such as
magnetic reconnection.
